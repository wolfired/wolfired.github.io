# MasterStiller Presents: MAMEMANIA PROJECT "The Absolute Perfection"

The first project that open MameManiaForverForum since its inception, from 2010. This is a collection dedicated to MAME that follows a careful selection of roms and chd folders, supporting an alternative preservation compared to the integral preservation. Personally i hate the preservation imposed by the developers, because i consider it unnecessary to be associated with emulation, preservation and emulation can not be always the same thing when it comes to games that are impossible to reproduce. It is emulated what can be reproduced, in this case we preserve what can be reproduced through the emulators. What can not be reproduced is preserved because it is important to preserve over time, this must not be obligated and required for public use on an emulator, specifically the MAME.

The big mistake that continues to be present in the structuring of MAME is the presence of a large number of games that are impossible to perform, even in the near future, in the year 4000. This presence forces besides the MAME developers, preservers and competition heroes to have an accumulation of useless and useless weight. My project for 8 years is fighting to exclude all this uselessness, carefully selecting the important roms and chd's to support in time.

This is not the integral collection, my project collects roms and chd folders reproducible, regardless of the emulation status WORKING or NOT WORKING and a small portion of non-reproducible games that i consider important to support preserving them over time. Are not excluded the clones, are not excluded genders such as: poker and slot machine, these genres are continually requested by some of my collectors users. Completion of the WORKING list is reached only at the collection level 4. Contrary to the integral collection, mine is a particular collection, let's say a true preservation altogether alternative and contrary to that integral.

MAMEMANIA PROJECT the future of the collection dedicated to MAME it's only here, you too become the a followers of MAMEMANIA.

# EASY GUIDE

1. Select an emulator structure: `MAME`, `MAMEUI` or `ARCADE`. It is possible to insert another executable downloading another emulator structure.

2. STRUCTURE INFO

* MAME ORIGINAL (official structure, as it is original)
* MAMEUI (MAME + graphical user interface)
* MAMEUB (new experimental build by MasterStiller)
* ARCADE (previously MAMEUIFX of Mamesick developed by Robert)
* NO NAG (remove the block that requires OK to start playing a game)
* NO MESS (excludes all references to MESS)
* GROOVYMAME and CRTMAME (specific for CRT monitors)
* NEGAMAME (to be combined with the NEGATRON GUI)
* GUI (Graphical User Interface)
* FRONT END (graphical user interface in attract mode for crafted cabinet)
* MAMEPGUI (customizable graphical user interface)
* MXUI (graphical user interface + IPS support)
* NEGATRON GUI (graphical user interface)

3. GENERAL INFO

* IPS (Internet Protocol Suite, using patches)
* CHEATS (use of tricks)
* ROMS (path dedicated to games)
* SAMPLES (sound sampling)
* HISTORY (info related to the game)
* HISCORE (list of champions records)
* SNAP (images that representing the games)
* TITLES (images of game titles)
* ICONS (icons to show in the selection of games)
* VARIOUS EXTRAS (images, videos, lists and other customizations in-game)

4. Extract the emulator structure you have chosen, creating the path to be established.

5. Place the roms folder inside the path of the emulator where there is the executable.

6. Execute the executable of the emulator or of the external GUI to be combined, to perform scanning the roms or updating the "available" list by refreshing (F5). Audit all games (it's the roms check, wait for the roms folder to scan). Refresh (this is the update of the available list that starts as an option or press the F5 key).

7. Ignore the number of missing referring to the missing games, follow only the "available" list (ie everything that will be available)

8. The folders dedicated to file with the extension .chd should be included in the roms folder, each folder has a specific name referring to a game, it is like a rom but extracted. For the completion of the roms folder, you must collect the .zip files and the folders dedicated to .chd files in the same path, then all inside the roms folder.

9. Some games require special settings, you have to be patient in the configure each individual game or more games in according to the same configuration.

10. The use of samples is an optional choice, they are not mandatory. Regarding the various extras situations (the additional decoration) each folder deals with showing representative images or reading files such as lists and information about the games.

# INCORRECTS QUESTION

1. MAMEUI BUILD

Attention: the MAMEUI build detects many incorrect, ignore this number and trust only the "available" list that i take care personally version after version. ;)

2. ARCADE BUILD

This is the difference that offers this emulator structure:

* Arcade games only
* NO Pinball (tables)
* NO poker games (-90%)
* NO gambling games
* NO systems that require software, such as computers and consoles
* If all the games of a specific source file are not functional, then they are removed.

NOT USE CLRMAMEPRO!!! The my roms are complete and verified at 100% for the relative version, ClrMamePro and other similar tools can destroy my personal romset.

3. Result of the incorrect - method 1 (found 9 incorrect)

StilleRomSet emulated on ARCADE emulator build by Robert

My roms folder (zip files and chd folders) after the audit all games should detects only 9 incorrect.

* Missing of rom/chd: gtfrk10ma (rom/chd unnecessary)
* Missing of rom/chd: gtfrk3ma (rom/chd unnecessary)
* Missing of rom/chd: gticlub2ea (rom/chd unnecessary)
* Missing of rom/chd: mbaao (rom/chd unnecessary)
* Missing of rom/chd: mushi2eo (rom/chd unnecessary)
* Missing of rom/chd: sscopefh (rom/chd unnecessary)
* Missing of rom/chd: tsurugie (rom/chd unnecessary)
* Missing of rom/chd: wcombatk (rom/chd unnecessary)
* Missing of rom/chd: wcombatu (rom/chd unnecessary)

This incorrect regard 9 games "NOT WORKING" (rom/chd not playable) that i esclude and will continue to exclude forever. Therefore the 9 incorrect in reality for our are equivalent to 0 real incorrect. If in case they found start to be 10 incorrect until to increase, you need to contact me and provide your scan results for help to solve the problem of the real ROM/CHD incorrect or missing.

4. Result of the incorrect - method 2 (found 0 incorrect)

Enable: enable new faster audit all games method.

# COLLECTION LEVEL

* LEVEL 1: <font color="#FBB700">CUSTOMIZED</font> (different weight)

* LEVEL 2: <font color="#008000">PARTIAL</font> (about 19 GB)

    * v0.202: 11.074 zip files
    * v0.203: 11.109 zip files

* LEVEL 3: <font color="#0000FF">SUPER</font> (about 82 GB)

    * v0.202: 11.074 zip files + 202 chd's folders
    * v0.203: 11.109 zip files + 202 chd's folders

* LEVEL 4: <font color="#800080">ULTRA</font> (about 194 GB)

    * v0.202: 11.074 zip files + 214 chd's folders
    * v0.203: 11.109 zip files + 214 chd's folders

You can choose one of these levels of collection:

* LEVEL 1: CUSTOMIZED (different weight)

This level is only recommended for use of the copy of the my romset to be managed personally in the normal way or in a cabin situation. It is forbidden to request help because everyone can have a different selection. In case of errors and other problems, re-copy my romset or re-download again.

* LEVEL 2: PARTIAL (about 19 GB)

This level is recommended for those who avoid all the chd folders, preferring only the roms. The eclusion of games in the chd format is not a good election, in this way you go to ignore a series of games such as: Area51, Killer Instict, Red Earth.

* LEVEL 3: SUPER (about 82 GB)

This is the recommended level to obtain a good collection. For a excessive weight are excluded the chd's of the laser disc games and the recent chd's of the Beatmania IIDX series.

* LEVEL 4: ULTRA (about 194 GB)

This is the final level that adds another 111.8 GB of weight which refers the chd's excluded in level 3. Can be defined the most extreme level to be reached.

Note: the weight cited it is not correct, is indicative and it can subject to changes in subsequent versions.

# QUESTION

1. Download the update of the roms from v0.202 to v0.203

2. Extract the archive, highlight and move all the content inside the roms folder.

3. Replace the files that will already be present.

4. It is important to replace the files, to allow the updated files to be operational, overwriting the previous ones that will prove to be incompatible.

5. Update and addition of new working chd: nothing at the moment.

6. Run the v0.203 of MAME or ARCADE in 32 or 64 bit (depending on your pc)

7. Perform the "audit all games" or the refresh (F5)

8. Ignore the "all games" list

9. Follow only the "available" list

10. Enjoy my collection updated to v0.203

# INFO

These are the exclusive hack roms for the "MAMEUB" structure. They are compressed in 7z to avoid confusion with the normal roms that are compressed in the zip format. The use of these roms it is optional and can be removed easily searching in the roms folder: .7z or 7z
